  - rscadd: "Mechs no longer use object verbs and the exosuit interface tab. They now use action buttons. Mechs now have a cycle equipment action button to change weapon faster than by using the view stats window. Mechs get two special alerts when their battery or health is low. Mechs now properly consume energy when moving and having their lights on. Using a mech tool that takes time to act now shows a progress bar (e.g. mech drill)."
